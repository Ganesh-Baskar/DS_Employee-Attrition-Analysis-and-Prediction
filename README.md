# DS_Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction

📟 Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing employee data to uncover the key drivers of attrition and build a predictive model that forecasts employee turnover. By leveraging this model, HR teams can make informed, data-driven decisions to boost retention strategies and reduce churn.

🚀 Key Features
- Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: Gather historical employee data and clean it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and visualize factors contributing to attrition.
- Feature Engineering: Convert raw attributes into refined features to improve model accuracy.
- Model Development: Train a variety of algorithms and select the most effective one.
- Performance Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Interactive Dashboard: Deploy the model via a Streamlit app for live predictions and easy access.

⚒️ Technologies & Tools
- Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Streamlit, pickle
- ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

🎯 Setup Instructions
- Create & Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
- Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt



🔮 Usage
Make predictions using the saved model:
import pickle  
import pandas as pd

with open('models/best_lgb__model.pkl', 'rb') as file:  
    model = pickle.load(file)

sample_data = pd.DataFrame({...})  # Replace with actual values  
prediction = model.predict(sample_data)  
print(prediction)


Launch the dashboard:
streamlit run app.py


Open the suggested URL to interact with the prediction interface.
